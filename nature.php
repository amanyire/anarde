                                <p style="text-align: justify;">ANARDE is a nonprofit group of researchers activists, organizers, and lawyers with expertise in human rights advocacy, environmental governance, corporate and government accountability. Our team works tirelessly and relentlessly in Uganda to ensure justice rights and accountability in the natural resources sector.<br/>

Natural resources more so, extractive resources must benefit every Ugandan especially the local communities where oil, gas and minerals are located. To this end the environment and land rights of such communities should be protected, in addition the generated revenues should be properly collected and utilized in a transparent and accountable manner for the benefit of the current and future generations. We therefore advocate for systems, practices and laws that mandate the disclosure of extractive revenues.<br/>

Civic competences are critical for continued engagement of people in positions of authority and participation in policy formulation. ANARDE therefore understands the critical value of protecting civic space is for improving governance in extractives<br/>

To ensure resource benefits accrue to all, Governments and extractives companies must ensure disclosure of resource contracts and provide a transparent trail to track beneficial ownership and disclosure commitments. In Karamoja and the Albertine Region, we train communities to among others, to demand for information such as mining contracts and access information relating to land and environmental compliance. Aware of the knowledge gaps, we are develop training programmes for selected agents of change to go well beyond accessibility, to understanding, asking the right questions and taking action in quest for rights, justice and accountability.<br/>

In the interest of social justice, we also anchor our work to sustainable development goals with particular emphasis to gender equality. ANARDE centers the voice of the marginalized people especially women to eradicate violence, harassment and abuse in the natural resource sector to have true equality. The world should be a better place for the current and future generations.</p>
